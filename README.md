# challenge11
All work was done independently and with the help of Xpert AI tool.

The code for part 1 can be found in "part_1_mars_news.ipynb" in the "challenge 11" repository on Github:
Part 1 was concerned with solidfying certain concepts for us - notably, web scraping. Using code like BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser'), we are able to turn data from a url into something that can be explored and manipulated.
It was also a challenge to find the correct id and correct class for the different objects that we wish to extract.
Finally, the use of for loops was essential for the analysis.


The code for part 2 can be found in "part_2_mars_weather.ipynb" in the "challenge 11" repository on Github:
This portion was concerned with teaching us the same skills from part 1, all while taking it a step further. By converting the extracted data into a pandas dataframe, we are able to create graphs and carry out a proper analysis.
The resulting dataframe is found in "mars_data.csv" in the "challenge 11" repository on Github.
